            <p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>ging is an inevitable, complex process that can be clinically described as having features such as <a href="https://www.marykay.ca/en-ca/love-your-skin/2020-07-skin-care-articles/2020-07-skin-care-routine-article"> wrinkles, sunspots, uneven skin colour and sagging skin.</a> Signs of aging begin to appear in your late 20s, and you start to produce 1% less collagen in the skin every year, and the rate of cell renewal begins to decline. In your 30s wrinkles begin to appear due to decreased collagen and elastin levels and the impact of repetitive facial expressions. For example, you may see fine lines and wrinkles in the eye area (crow’s feet) and smile or forehead lines.Cell turnover begins to slow in your early 30s, contributing to uneven skin tone and tired, dull-looking skin.</p>
            
                <!--BLOCKQUOTE 1-->

                <blockquote>Even though aging can definitely feel jarring or scary for some people when those first signs of aging start to appear, aging is natural and not a bad thing! What’s truly important is that you take care of your skin so it can be beautiful and healthy at any age.</blockquote>

                <h2>What does essential skin care <br> look like in my 30s?</h2>

            <p>In addition to having a <a href="https://www.marykay.ca/en-ca/love-your-skin/2020-07-skin-care-articles/2020-07-skin-care-routine-article">basic skin care routine</a> (cleansing, moisturizing and UV protection), add age-fighting products that target fine lines and wrinkles, and uneven skin tone along with other more noticeable signs of aging to your regimen. Choosing the right age-defying products for your skin can help reduce premature signs of aging and keep your skin looking healthier and younger.</p>
            
                <!--ORDERED LIST-->

                <ol> 
                    <li>Facial Cleanser - Cleanse day and night to help remove makeup, dirt and impurities that can lead to blocked pores and breakouts.</li>
                    <li>Antioxidant Serum - Use an antioxidant-rich serum to protect against free radicals on skin, which can contribute to premature skin aging including fine lines, pigment changes and textural irregularities.</li>
                    <li>Exfoliation Product - Remove dead skin layers and speed up your skin cell turnover to help give you radiant skin.</li>
                    <li>Moisturizing Sunscreen - Choose a moisturizing cream that contains SPF to keep skin hydrated and protected from environmental stressors such as UV radiation. Sunscreen protects your skin from UVA rays that contribute to wrinkles and brown spots and UVB rays that contribute to sunburn. Daily use of a sunscreen is a must.</li>
                    <li>Retinol - Add a topical Retinol product to your regimen to help improve the overall texture and even-toned skin. Apply it at night and avoid your eye area.</li>
                    <li>Moisturizer or Hydrating Face Mask: Use a hydrating cream or a moisturizing face mask to help skin retain the moisture it needs to promote softer, smoother, more supple-looking skin.</li>
                    <li>Eye Cream - Use an eye cream both day and night to hydrate the skin around the eyes and increase suppleness.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Skin care tip - <br> Skin type recommendation</h2>

                <p>If you have normal skin, your skin does not experience dryness or oiliness. Since your skin is more forgiving than other skin types, you can easily try cleansers, moisturizers and masks until you find what works for you. But what about the other skin types?</p>

Oil has more staying power than do lotions and prevents the evaporation of water from the skin's surface. Another possibility is a petrolatum-based product (Vaseline, Aquaphor, others)</td>
                     <td>To help control oily skin, dermatologists recommend the following tips: DO wash your face every morning, evening, and after exercise. While washing, resist the temptation to scrub your skin, even to remove makeup. Scrubbing irritates your skin, which can make it look worse</td>
                     <td>For combination skin, some dermatologists recommend using two different moisturizers to treat your separate skin woes. The Derm Review suggests treating dry skin areas with an emollient-rich moisturizer, while treating oily skin areas with a moisturizer that contains acne-fighting ingredients.</td>

                     <p>Skin aging is generally the same regardless of gender. With aging, the slowing down in collagen production results in a <a href="https://www.marykay.ca/en-ca/love-your-skin/2020-07-skin-care-articles/2020-07-skin-care-routine-article">loss of hydration</a> and skin thinning which can lead to the appearance of wrinkles. So if you already have a basic regimen (cleanser, SPF protection, and moisturization), focus on products that target fine lines, wrinkles and uneven skin tone.</p>
            
                     <blockquote>Even people who already have signs of premature skin aging can benefit from making lifestyle changes. By protecting your skin from the sun, you give it a chance to repair some of the damage.</blockquote>
                     
                     <p>However, men generally don’t focus on skin care as much as women do. Male grooming habits and behavioral differences also contribute to different skin needs compared with women. For example, daily or weekly shaving with razors can contribute to increased irritation and dryness. Men are also less likely to protect themselves against sun damage and nourish their skin compared to women, so they need to make sure they’re focusing on that.</p>

                    <dt>Is it possible for me to have youthful, firm,<br> wrinkle-free skin in my 30s?</dt>
                    <dd>Healthy skin is attributed to lifestyle, environmental factors and genetics. As I mentioned before, there is a reduction in collagen production as you age, which leads to thinning skin and the development of fine lines and wrinkles. However, sun damage is largely responsible for the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of firmness. Avoid overexposure to the sun where possible. Having a good anti-aging regimen including sunscreen can help protect against and prevent the signs of aging, maintain healthy skin long-term and give skin a more radiant appearance.</dd>

                    <dd>Acne is caused when the pores of your skin are plugged with sebum (oil), dead skin cells, or bacteria, so I suggest effective cleansing with salicylic acid. This key ingredient promotes the easy removal of dead skin cells and helps unclog pores of dirt and sebum to resolve and prevent lesions.</dd>

                    <dd>Aging is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors and less based on ethnic origin. Environment and lifestyle are some of the key factors that impact facial skin aging. The visual signs of skin aging, such as wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and lack of skin elasticity, can occur in all ethnicities.</dd>

                <h3>How does skin change in my 40s and 50s?</h3>

                <p>Your 40s could be a bit of a turning point for your skin. You may notice more signs of aging in the form of - </p>
            
                <!--UNORDERED LIST 1-->

                <ul> 
                    <li>Increase in fine lines and the development of deep wrinkles</li>
                    <li>Loss in volume and skin elasticity resulting in sagging skin, flattening of the cheeks and a noticeable change in jawline contours</li>
                    <li>Increase in skin dryness and roughness</li>
                    <li>Increase in hyperpigmentation (age spots), uneven skin tone and less radiant skin</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What causes these changes?</h3>

                <p>These signs of aging in your 40s and 50s may happen for a variety of reasons — some of which are completely natural parts of the aging process!</p>
            
                <!--UNORDERED LIST 1-->

                <ul> 
                    <li>The skin’s natural exfoliation process slows down, contributing to uneven skin tone and tired, dull-looking skin</li>
                    <li>A gradual reduction in skin nutrients could lead to less-radiant skin</li>
                    <li>As skin further matures, we lose more hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is important for skin hydration. Hence, the skin will be more prone to dryness</li>
                    <li>Additionally, the skin’s natural ability to maintain barrier function is diminished, which could lead to dry, rough skin</li>
                    <li>As you age, there is a reduction in collagen production. Signs of aging become more pronounced. This reduction can lead to deep wrinkles and expression lines and lines on the forehead and along the nasolabial folds</li>
                </ul>
